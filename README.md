# Solar PV System Simulation

This repository contains a Python script for simulating the power-voltage (P-V) and current-voltage (I-V) curves of a photovoltaic (PV) system. The script generates a plot of the system-level P-V and I-V curves with a shaded operating range that represents the most efficient operating voltage range for the PV system.

## Installation

Before running this simulation, ensure you have Python installed on your system. Additionally, you will need the following packages:
- numpy
- matplotlib

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
